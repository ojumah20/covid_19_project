**Covid-19 Severity Prediction App**
![alt text for screen readers](https://github.com/ojumah20/covid_19_project/blob/main/COVID%20testing%20policy%20drupal.jpg "covid-19").

SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide, causing significant social and economic disruptions. Despite vaccination efforts and medical advancements, the virus remains a major global health concern, with over 763 million confirmed cases and 6 million reported deaths as of the latest data. The influx of COVID-19 patients has strained healthcare systems, requiring efficient resource allocation and patient prioritization based on severity. Current diagnostic methods can detect the presence of the virus but not the severity of the illness, necessitating supplementary approaches like blood testing, serology, medical imaging, and clinical notes analysis. However, the multitude of parameters from these tests can be challenging for physicians to interpret. Utilizing statistical or machine learning methods could help analyze these parameters and predict COVID-19 severity more accurately, ultimately improving patient outcomes by identifying patterns and providing precise prognostic information.
A web app was developed to predict based on selected features if a patient has covid-19 and to what intensity. There are four levels being predicted for : no civid-19, regular case of covid-19, semi-intensive case and intensive.
Intial dtaa source was made up 110 features which through feature selection wer streamlined to only five.

Further Work
There is a need for error handling especailly when a user input a text or anything other than a float.
The look and feel of the web app can also be improve. I am opened to open source contributions.
